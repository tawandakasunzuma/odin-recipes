    <ul>
        <li>3 cups (660g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>4cm piece ginger (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon quill</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 cups (300g) cake flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>75g unsalted butter (chopped)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125ml) milk</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil (to deep-fry)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make syrup, combine sugar, ginger, cinnamon, lemon juice and 2 cups (500ml) water in a pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves, then cook for 3-4 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and chill for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place flour, baking powder and butter in a food processor and whiz until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add nutmeg, egg, milk and a pinch of salt, and whiz until combined. Form into a disc, enclose in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until 7mm thick. Cut into twelve 10cm x 5cm rectangles, then cut 3 lines lengthways into each rectangle, leaving a 1cm boarder at one end to hold the strips together. Plait the 3 strips and pinch end to seal. Cover with a clean damp tea towel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set bowl of syrup over a bowl of iced water (syrup must be very cold). Half fill a deep-fryer or large saucepan with oil and heat until 170Â°C. In batches, cook the doughnuts, turning, for 3 minutes or until dark golden. Immediately soak in syrup for 1 minute, then drain on a wire rack.
